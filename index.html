					Avoid all the discs for as long as possible and bat away discs in tight situations.
					I was gifted an original Gameboy, there was a Disc Room themed game jam thus I connected the two and Disc Batter was born.
					Being written in assembly, this game opened my eyes to data oriented programming in that it was crystal clear when the data was not layed out in an optimal way such that memory shuffling and jumps were kept to a minimum when operating on said data.

					Puzzle platformer involving the repair of conveniently placed vases.
					The player's gun forces the halves of a vase to join back together while the enemy's gun eliminates the player and breaks vases.
					This project was the culmination of lots of prototypes made with Godot Engine, leading to quick development of the main mechanic, allowing me to focus on level design over the course of a weekend for Global Game Jam 2020.

					A rigged and animated character tech demo for the Playstation 1, I've always wanted to give back to the console of my childhood and this is one step closer.
					After creating the character from start to finish in Blender, I wrote an exporter in Python to output the model in a custom format optimised for the Playstation 1's fixed graphics pipeline.
					Ex: the vertices are sorted by the bones they are attached to, allowing the renderer to update the vertices' positions with just one pass over the vertex data.

				<h3>Global Illumination Renderer with Temporal Sampling</h3>

					Real-time renderer made as part of my thesis.
					Implements a global illumination algorithm (IGI) to be run on the GPU.
					Previous frames are reused via temporal sampling to further optimise the renderer for dynamic environments.
					This is done by splitting up light bounce sources into seperate sets across a number of frames, meaning that only a fraction of light bounce sources are calculated per frame, and the rest of the light are re-projected from previous framebuffers to the new camera orientation
